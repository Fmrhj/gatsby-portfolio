Whether it is to try a new programming language or just to practice, it is good to have a few problems at hand and to have solved at least a few of them. Here a short list:

### Project Euler

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) 

To date, they have more than 770 mathematical problems. 

Note: you can fetch a certain problem with the routing: `https://projecteuler.net/problem={ID}`.

### Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

This one is actually a yearly competition where participants try to solve daily programming challenges during [advent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent). Each problem has two parts and they include a test data set. Solving each part grants half star to complete the total 25. It is free and sign up is required to be able to participate. Problems date back to 2015.

Note: GET url `https://adventofcode.com/{YEAR}/day/{DAY}`

### USA Computer Olympiad

[USACO](http://www.usaco.org)

You can retrieve the problems since the contests back to 2011, including test data and solutions. 

### Facebook Hacker Cup

[Facebook Hacker Cup](https://www.facebook.com/codingcompetitions/hacker-cup)

Also interesting problems but more into the competitive programming scene. They even upload screecasts to follow top participants solving the problems. Repository of problems goes back to 2011.

### Code-Golf

[Code Golf](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/code-golf)

Goes **deeeper** into the computer science perspective of solving a challenge. Interesting to a have a look. Definitely check out their [FAQ](https://codegolf.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1280).
