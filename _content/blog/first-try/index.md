To start a blog is not as easy as I thought. It requires discipline, dedication and time. Regardless of the subject, to take a look on the latest stand of a subject, to condense an idea and to write about it, is  an interesting fullfilling endeavour. Kind of the culmination of learning should be to try to explain it to somebody else right away. Following the principles of the great explainer Richard Feynmann and his [well-renowned technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD-_fcpylcE), I would like to explain concepts in plain and simple language.  

I have been reading and working lately around parallel computing. So let's start with that. 

## (Py)OpenCL for parallel computing
