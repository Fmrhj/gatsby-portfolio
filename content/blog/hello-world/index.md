description: "Blog with React, Gatsby and Netlify"
---
If you are able to read this, it means we succeeded! This blog will be hosted with [Netlify's CDN](https://www.netlify.com/) and [CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/gatsby/). 

It has been an interesting path learning the basics of [React JS](https://reactjs.org/) and sort of bootstrapping everything with [Gatby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). I have been looking for a while different alternatives (e.g. [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com)) and this is the one that suits the most my basic requirements. 

I will be structuring a series of topics towards Data Science in the Cloud, specifically in the Azure landscape, which is where I have been working on in the recent time.
