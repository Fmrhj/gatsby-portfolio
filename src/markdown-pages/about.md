I am a Data Scientist having fun developing cloud native solutions. I currently live in <span class="colored-text_1">Berlin</span>.
<br></br>
I like to design systems, specially interested in <span class="colored-text_3">ML</span>, <span class="colored-text_3">ML Ops</span> and <span class="colored-text_3">Data-Intensive Computing</span>.
<br></br>
I really enjoy learning and apply new concept practically to solve real problems. I take notes constantly while learning a new subject and I will be saving some of them in the :closed_book: [notes](/notes) section.
