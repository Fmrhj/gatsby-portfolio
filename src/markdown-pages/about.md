I am a Data Scientist having fun developing cloud native solutions. I currently live in <span class="colored-text_1">Berlin</span>.

I like to design systems, specially interested in <span class="colored-text_3">Machine Learning</span>, <span class="colored-text_3">Rapid Deployment</span> and <span class="colored-text_3">Data-Intensive Computing</span>.

I really enjoy learning and apply new concept practically to solve real problems. I take notes :notebook: constantly while learning a new subject and I will be posting some of them regularly in the [blog](/blog) section.
