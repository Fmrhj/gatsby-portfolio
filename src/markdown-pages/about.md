I am a Data Scientist having fun developing Cloud native applications. I currently live in <span class="colored-text_1">Berlin</span>.

I like to design systems, specially interested in <span class="colored-text_3">Machine Learning</span> and <span class="colored-text_3">Rapid Deployment of AI applications</span>.

I really enjoy learning new concepts and applying these practically to solve real problems.
